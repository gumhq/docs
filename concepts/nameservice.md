  Exploring NameServices role in decentralised systems and the significance of
  '.gum' screen names

# ðŸ“› NameService

A NameService in decentralised systems functions much like the Domain Name System (DNS), but operates in a decentralised way for increased security and ownership. Essentially, it maps complex blockchain addresses to simpler, more memorable "screen names" for easier user interaction. Different implementations exist for specific use cases, such as the GplNameService, which allows users to claim unique '.gum' screen names. These services not only facilitate user-friendly navigation, but also empower users with personalized digital identity management.
