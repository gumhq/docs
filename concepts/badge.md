# üèÖ Badge

One of the many innovative features Gum offers is the concept of Badges. These Badges serve as an on-chain identification tool that app developers can grant to profiles for a variety of reasons.

### Badge

\
A Badge on Gum is akin to a digital credential, granted to a profile to signify an achievement, status, or affiliation with a specific app. The first key use case for Badges revolves around application development. An app developer might issue a Badge to identify that a particular user has signed up with their app or has been onboarded by it. The Badge represents a public, verifiable endorsement that strengthens the profile's credibility within the network. It provides an additional layer of assurance, bridging trust between users, their profiles, and apps.

### Issuer

The Issuer is the entity responsible for granting Badges. While the issuer can be anyone within the network, there's an internal verification process that ensures only verified issuers can issue Badges. This process ensures the integrity and credibility of the Badges issued within the Gum ecosystem.

### Schema

The Schema acts as a blueprint for the Badge. It outlines the required and optional fields and establishes the format of the Badge. Gum already has a defined Schema for Badges, ensuring consistency and predictability in the way Badges are created and issued.

### Getting Started

If you're an app developer or a prospective Issuer seeking to issue Badges to your users, the process is straightforward. Contact the Gum team on Discord to discuss your needs. Once your Issuer status is verified, you can start issuing Badges, enhancing your app's engagement with users, and improving their on-chain identity.
