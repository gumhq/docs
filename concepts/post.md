# ‚úç Post

A Post signifies an expressive communication tool linked to a Profile, encapsulating a domain's digital identity. It allows Profiles to share various types of content such as text, images, videos, audio, and more within the network.

The role of a Post extends beyond the boundaries of traditional content sharing. It's not merely about information dissemination; it's also about the representation of the domain's intent and identity. Through Posts, domains express their narratives, interests, and viewpoints to the network.

Engagement on Posts, including actions such as liking, commenting, and sharing, forms an integral part of network interactions. Every engagement with a Post helps to shape the Social Graph dynamically, offering insights into network trends, interests, and the overall pulse of the network.

In essence, a Post is not just a piece of content within the network; it's a conduit for domains to interact, express, and contribute to the evolving Social Graph landscape.
