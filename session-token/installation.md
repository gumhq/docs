# ðŸ§© Installation

Session Keys are a part of the Gum React-SDK, so you need to install the package using either yarn or npm:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Yarn" %}
`yarn add @gumhq/react-sdk`
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="NPM" %}
`npm i @gumhq/react-sdk`
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

With the package installed, you can now begin integrating the session wallet management system into your dApp for enhanced security and user experience.
