# ðŸ“œ Overview

**Quickstart**

The [Gum SDK](https://github.com/gumhq/sdk/tree/master) is fully open-source and easy to use. The Quickstart section should help you get started with using it.

We've also made an [#example-app](../protocol-overview/quickstart.md#example-app "mention") for you to get familiar with using the SDK for your app.

### Concepts

**NameService**

NameServices in decentralised systems are similar to the Domain Name System (DNS) on the web, mapping unique and user-friendly 'screen names' to network addresses. Unlike DNS, they offer more security through decentralisation. Variants like ANSNameService, SNSNameService, and GplNameService cater to different needs. Notably, GplNameService lets users claim unique '.gum' screen names, enhancing personalisation and ownership of digital identity. In essence, NameServices simplify navigation and digital identity management in decentralised networks.

**Smart Profiles**

A Profile represents a unique digital identity within a specific domain, enriched by metadata like name, bio, and avatar. This metadata can vary based on the domain, reflecting relevant aspects about an individual or entity in different contexts. A domain can host multiple profiles, and similarly, an entity can have multiple profiles across various domains, providing versatility in identity representation across the network.

**Posts**

A Post, linked to a Profile, serves as a versatile tool for sharing various types of content, thus embodying a domain's digital identity within the network. However, Posts are more than mere content-sharing platforms; they represent a domain's narrative and intent. Interactions on Posts like likes, comments, and shares dynamically shape the Social Graph, providing insights into network trends. Therefore, Posts are conduits for domains to express, interact, and contribute to the network's evolving landscape.

**Connections**

Connections, the relationships formed when one Profile follows another, facilitate information exchange and interactions among domains. They help align similar interests, promoting collaboration and enhancing network relevance. By shaping the Social Graph, connections enable more personalised and meaningful network experiences.

**Reactions**

Reactions provide an interactive way for Profiles to express sentiments about Posts, ranging from emojis to textual responses. They foster a vibrant environment for engagement and shared experiences, nurturing community development and interconnection based on mutual interests and emotional resonance.
